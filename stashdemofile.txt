This is the code that i would commit to local repo and also push to central repo, before i will be asked to work on some other tasks




First Feature : Now , this is the code i was assigned to start working on, when something would come up due to which i wont be able to add or commit this







Second Feature :- Now , say this is the urgent piece of work for which i had to send the file with code for Feature1 to stash

To check the differences using git diff
